# README!
## Different folder contains different code without model state file. 
## For iterative methods, just simply download a vgg19 .pth file and run .ipynb file.
## For other methods, you can contact me to get trained model or simply visit https://disk.pku.edu.cn/link/AA3721AEEF8DEB486DAE1B4BFEB820C23D to download before 2/28/2025. 
## If you are interested in Coco & Wikiart dataset, you could also find them in the link above to get (perhaps) faster download speed.
## hope you enjoy our work!
